        question: "Can I edit my attendance after marking it?",

    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I switch semester or branch?",
        answer: "You can update your semester or branch in your Profile settings. Your past data remains preserved and new data starts accumulating accordingly."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I export or download my attendance?",

        question: "I forgot my password. How do I reset it?",
